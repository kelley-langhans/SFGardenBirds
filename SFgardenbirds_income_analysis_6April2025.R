# all 4 in income dataset, not shapefile are sensible, I've excluded them
# these 4 are 1) alcatraz + treasure island, which I've excluded 06075017903
# 2) the farallons, which I've excluded 06075980401
# 3) part of the ocean, which I've exluded 06075990100
# 4) another part of the ocean

# census tract 9805.01 has 99 households, mclaren park
# census tract 9809 has 127 households, looks mostly industrial north of bayview

# workflow: fill in missing data for target tracts (off of R by hand, and document how each filled in)

# also subset out <400, leave these as legitimate missing data on the map and in dealing with calculations
