# SFGardenBirds
Code to accompany Langhans et al. 2025 in Landscape and Urban Planning, "Urban community gardens foster positive human-avian interactions across an income gradient in San Francisco"

See SFgardenbirds_code_readme for description of code and correct order to run scripts in.

All data for running code available in Data_SFGardenBirds.zip. Data readme also included in that file.

Note that only partial survey data has been provided and it has been anonymized to protect participants. Furthermore, as zip codes constitute identifiable data, zip code data and related analysis (to determine the median distance gardeners live from the garden they attend) is not included. For a distrubtion of distances from where gardeners live to their gardeners, please see the supplementary figures.
